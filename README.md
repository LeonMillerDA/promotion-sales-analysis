## Project Overview
**Problem:** The fast-food chain wants to launch a new menu item but is unsure which of three marketing campaigns will maximize sales.  

**Goal:** Evaluate the A/B testing results to determine which promotion is most effective.  

**Target Variable:** `SalesInThousands` â€“ weekly sales of the new menu item per store.  

**Business Impact:** Identifying the most effective promotion helps the chain allocate marketing resources efficiently, increasing sales and minimizing the cost of ineffective campaigns.

## Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Fast Food Marketing Campaign AB Test](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test?resource=download)  

**Scenario:**  
A fast-food chain plans to add a new menu item and is testing three marketing campaigns to determine which drives the highest sales. The item was introduced at stores in randomly selected markets, with a different promotion at each location. Weekly sales were recorded for the first four weeks.  

**Goal:**  
Evaluate A/B testing results and decide which promotion is most effective.  

**Shape:** 4 weeks Ã— *n* stores Ã— 7 columns  

**Columns / Feature Types:**  
- **MarketID** (Categorical): Unique identifier for each market  
- **MarketSize** (Categorical): Size of market area by sales  
- **LocationID** (Categorical): Unique identifier for each store  
- **AgeOfStore** (Numerical): Age of store in years  
- **Promotion** (Categorical): One of three promotions tested  
- **week** (Categorical / Numerical): Week number (1â€“4) when promotion ran  
- **SalesInThousands** (Numerical): Sales amount for a specific LocationID, Promotion, and week  

**Key Features:**  
- **Promotion** â€“ main variable for analysis  
- **SalesInThousands** â€“ target variable  
- **MarketSize & AgeOfStore** â€“ additional factors affecting sales

## Scenario & Goal
A fast-food chain ran multiple promotions and collected weekly sales data. The dataset contains **4 weeks of data across multiple stores**, providing a snapshot of promotion performance.  
The goal is to identify the most effective promotion to guide business decisions.

## OLS Regression
- Fitted an OLS model with promotion as a categorical variable.  
- Regression summary includes coefficients, p-values, and RÂ².  

**OLS Regression Results:**

## Residual Diagnostics

**Checks performed:**  
- Residuals approximately normal.

## ANOVA & Post-hoc Testing
- ANOVA confirms overall differences between promotions.  
- Tukey HSD identifies which promotions differ significantly.
